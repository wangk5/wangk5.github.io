	<h1>Hi, I'm Katherine.</h1>

		<p><b><em>I am interested in the applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Neuroscience.</em></b>
			I was New Jersey born and New Mexico raised, and have returned to New Jersey to pursue
			my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on Neuroscience and Statistics/Machine 
			Learning at Princeton University. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a <em>researcher</em> in the <a href="http://pni.princeton.edu">Princeton Neuroscience Insitute<a>, Certified Nurse Assistant, 
			<a href="https://s18.hackprinceton.com">HackPrinceton<a> and <a href="https://princetonmedihack.io">MediHack<a> organizer,
			and fashion blogger (<a href="https://belpetite.wordpress.com">@thebelpetite<a>).

			and work experiences at the <a href="http://losalamosmedicalcenter.com">Los Alamos Medical Center<a> and 
			<a href="https://d3b.center">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia<a>.
			I found that my love for computation and data intersected with this curiosity in the fields of Data Science
			and Machine Learning, which brings me to today...
